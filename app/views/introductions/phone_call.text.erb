Hi <%= @contact.first_name %>,

I noticed your <%= @published_at.strftime('%B') %> <%= @published_at.year %> publication in <%= @contact.info[:journal] %>.

I'm with experiment.com - we're a crowd-funding platform for scientific research (think Kickstarter for research). We've gotten a lot of feedback that we need more <%= @keyword %> projects, so I thought I’d reach out to you.

I was wondering if you have a side-project you'd consider crowd-funding (usually $5-10k to collect some preliminary data). I can tell you more about what the process entails and answer any questions you have.

If you’re free some time this week, I’d be happy to give you a call, just let me know when!

cheers,
Oscar
