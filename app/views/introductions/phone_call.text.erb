Hi <%= @contact.first_name %>,

I saw the recent article about your work in <%= @contact.info[:source] %> (<%= @contact.info[:url] %>).

I'm with experiment.com - we're a crowd-funding platform for scientific research (think Kickstarter for science). We’ve funded 125 projects, totaling just over $700k, but they’ve been limited to only a few fields. We’d love to explore topics in physiology: nutrition, exercise, and sleep, among others. In scanning through the news I came across your article, and I wanted to reach out.

I was wondering if you have a side-project you'd consider crowd-funding. I'd be happy to talk more about what the process entails. Feel free to give me a call anytime at 206-512-5031.

To avoid a potential game of phone-tag, you can also let me know what time you're free this week. I can give you a call then.

cheers,

Oscar
