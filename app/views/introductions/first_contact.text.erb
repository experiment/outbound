Hi <%= @contact.name %>,

I saw the recent article about your work in <%= @contact.source %> (!!URL!!).

I'm with experiment.com - we're a crowd-funding platform for scientific research (think Kickstarter for science). We've gotten a lot of feedback that we "need more neuroscience projects!" so we'll be launching a Neuroscience category in May.

I was wondering if you have a side-project you'd consider crowd-funding. I'd be happy to talk more about what the process entails. Feel free to give me a call anytime at 206-512-5031.

To avoid a potential game of phone-tag, you can also let me know what time you're free this week. I can give you a call then.

cheers,

Oscar
