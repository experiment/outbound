Thanks for taking a minute to talk today. I just wanted to provide a couple of relevant links that we discussed, as well as some extra info that might be useful.

Project form
https://experiment.com/start/<%= @contact.token %>
- This is where you can see what’s required and start crafting a project
- Your work is saved, so there’s no need to complete it all in one sitting
- There are lots of tips, examples, and best practices

https://experiment.com/faq - This covers everything from how we work with universities (no indirect costs) to updating supporters on progress. Definitely worth taking a look!

Of course, if you come up with questions, don’t hesitate to call or email me!

Happy <%= Date.today.strftime('%A') %>,
Oscar
