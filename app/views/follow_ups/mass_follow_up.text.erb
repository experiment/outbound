Hi <%= @contact.first_name %>,

<% if @contact.info.has_key? :journal %>
I’m just following up on an email I sent a few weeks ago - I had seen your <%= @contact.info[:paper][:published_at].to_date.strftime('%B') %> <%= @contact.info[:paper][:published_at].to_date.year %> article in <%= @contact.info[:journal] %>.
<% else %>
I’m just following up on an email I sent a few weeks ago - I had seen your article in <%= @contact.info[:source] %>
<% end %>

Why I bring this up: I’m with Experiment.com. We specialize in funding early-stage research projects by way of “crowd-funding” (similar concept to Kickstarter). We’re actively looking for <%= @keyword %> research projects - the more outlandish the better!

Here is a recent example of the type of research we fund:

My point: would you consider this for your own research (or that of a graduate student)? I know this is a little radical - please let me know if you have questions, I’m happy to explain more!

Best,
Oscar
